        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tartufo is a classic Italian dessert that you can make at home. It requires some patience as there is freezing time involved. Rolling the tartufos in pistachio and cookie crumbs is extra delicious.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (5.2 ounce) boxes shallot and chive flavored Gournay cheese (such as BoursinÂ®)</li>
            <li>1 pint grape tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces pasta</li>

            <li>1 lemon, juiced (optional)</li>

                <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Let ice cream stand at room temperature until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Line 8 small bowls with plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Using a 2 oz. (1/4-cup) ice-cream scoop, place 1 scoop of ice cream into the bottom of each bowl. Gently press a maraschino cherry into the top of each ice-cream scoop, then top each with another 2 oz. (1/4-cup) scoop of ice cream.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Working with 1 bowl of ice cream at a time, gather overhanging plastic, wrap it up around ice cream, and gently twist it to form a ball. Freeze until ice cream is firm and set, about 2 hours.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Place chocolate chips in a large microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on HIGH in  (30-second) intervals, stirring thoroughly between intervals, until melted, 3 to 4 minutes total. Whisk in coconut oil until oil is completely melted and mixture is combined. Let cool slightly at room temperature, about 10 minutes.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, pulse cookies and pistachios, if using, in a food processor until finely ground, about 15 quick pulses. Transfer to a shallow bowl, and set aside at room temperature.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Working with 1 ice-cream ball at a time, remove ice-cream ball from freezer. Remove plastic wrap, and place ice-cream ball on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Pour chocolate mixture over ice-cream ball, allowing it to thinly coat the top and sides.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If coating in cookie mixture, quickly and carefully invert chocolate-coated ice-cream ball into cookie mixture, rolling until evenly coated. Transfer coated ice cream ball to a clean wire rack set inside a large, rimmed baking sheet in the freezer. Repeat process with remaining 7 ice-cream balls, returning to the freezer after each one. Freeze until set, about 1 hour, or until ready to serve.</p>
